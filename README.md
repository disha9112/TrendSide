# About

TrendSide is an E-commerce application, built with React and Redux.

Users can create an account to sign up, or sign in directly with a Google account.

In addition to the various catalogs and diversity of items provided, users have the ability to add to or remove items from their cart.

They can access the checkout page from the cart to access their added items and the grand total. A payment gateway has been used to ensure secure and successful processing of payments.
